# Flask Task Manager
 This is a simple Task Manager application developed using Python and SQLite. The application enables users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. Users can also search for tasks and mark them as completed. The application utilizes the Bootstrap framework for a responsive and user-friendly interface.  It stores data in an SQLite database and renders the front-end using the Jinja2 template engine.
